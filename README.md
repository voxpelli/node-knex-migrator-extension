# node-knex-migrator-extension

An extension of the knex migrator. Initial version based on knex 0.7, still works on knex 0.12

Started out based on some PR:s to knex itself:

- https://github.com/knex/knex/pull/617
- https://github.com/knex/knex/pull/409

Then got the addition of [child migrations](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-knex-migrator-extension/commit/04eb5be9556603f70cb2f99f270edd5d487a439e)
